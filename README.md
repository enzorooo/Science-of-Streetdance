# The Science of Streetdance
*Developer:* **Juan Lorenzo Mercado**

As a dancer, I was able to train day-in and day-out with various training regimens from the dance teams that I have joined. In high school our dance team was regarded as a varsity team as there were various competitions that we have participated and competed in. We were refered to as athelete-artists. This is new category that specializes in both creativity and atheltic activity. The artistic side of things were seen in activities such as crafting dance routines, freestyle dancing, and even routine conceptualization. While dancers were also refered to as atheletes because of the atheletic requirements of dancing, competitions that are present, and even streetdance becoming a sport in recent years has contributed to this.

This opens up the question, can Streetdance as a sport develop intricate numerical systems in which can benefit dance teams to improve their routines based on numbers and other arithmetic results? This inquiry pops out at the fact that other sports such as Basketball, Football, and other various sports has become an area where data and mathematics are helping teams improve through numbers.

Streetdance competitions has become technical in various aspects determining the score of a routine through a panel of judges. However, how exactly do judges judge a routine? This repository serves as an open repository in identifying various areas where we can explore such questions with regards to data and Streetdance.

## Rationale
This Data science project seeks to analyze the various fields where Streetdance is involved with various datasets. It seeks to analyze findings in hopes to improve the competitive landscape of competitive Streetdance through various applications in Data Science.
