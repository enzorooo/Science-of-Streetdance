# The Science of Streetdance
*Developer:* **Juan Lorenzo Mercado**

As a dancer, I was able to train day-in and day-out with various training regimens from the dance teams that I have joined. In high school our dance team was regarded as a varsity team as there were various competitions that we have participated and competed in. We were refered to as athelete-artists. This is new category that specializes in both creativity and atheltic activity. The artistic side of things were seen in activities such as crafting dance routines, freestyle dancing, and even routine conceptualization. While dancers were also refered to as atheletes because of the atheletic requirements of dancing, competitions that are present, and even streetdance becoming a sport in recent years has contributed to this.

This opens up the question, can Streetdance as a sport develop intricate numerical systems in which can benefit dance teams to improve their routines based on numbers and other arithmetic results? This inquiry pops out at the fact that other sports such as Basketball, Football, and other various sports has become an area where data and mathematics are helping teams improve through numbers.

Streetdance competitions has become technical in various aspects determining the score of a routine through a panel of judges. However, how exactly do judges judge a routine? Through the Hip Hop International 2019 competition this project is aimed to determine if there are any insights that can be gained through the results of a competition in the hope of supporting the competitiveness of Streetdance as a growing sport around the globe.

## Rationale
TThis Data science project seeks to analyze the score cards of teams within dance competition Hip Hop International 2019. It seeks to analyze the results of each team in various stages of the competition. The project also serves as a exploratory analysis on insights that can be gathered based on the dataset extracted from the results of the competition. Moreover, the study also hopes to find insights with regards to how judging is conducted throughout the competition.
